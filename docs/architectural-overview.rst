Architectural Overview
======================

Design goals
------------

The development of plone.app.event was done with following design goals in
mind:

  [a] Encapsulation and independence: All event related code should reside in a
  seperate package (splitted into other packages, where appropriate). Plone
  should be least dependend on plone.app.event. Best would be that one can
  deinstall this feature completly.

  [b] Dexterity and Archetypes support: plone.app.event should provide
  Dexterity behaviors, which can be used in Dexterity types and an ATEvent
  content type (factored out from ATContentTypes) as a replacement for the
  Products.ATContentType ATEvent.

  [c] Standards compliancy: the iCalendar / `RFC5545
  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545>`_ standard is wonderful flexible, so
  plone.app.event should provide support for it by allowing ical exports. This
  is also available for the current ATContentType based implementation, but
  plone.app.event aims to improve it. A future goal is to support CalDAV also.

  [d] Recurring events support based on the RFC5545 standard.

  [e] A modern dateinput widget.

  [f] Features like whole-day-events.

  [g] Timezone support.

Encapsulation and independence: plone.app.event provides the Archetypes based
type and the Dexterity behaviors via two other subpackages in that package: at
and dx. Based on installed features (Products.ATContentTypes or
plone.dexterity, respectively), eather of those subpackages are included via
the zcml:condition statement. The calendar and event portlets were moved from
plone.app.portlets into plone.app.event, where they belong semantically - thus
improving encapsulation and independence and reducing interwoven dependencies.
The calendar portlet was completly refactored. The functionality of the
CalendarTool (portal_calendar) was reimplenented. Important settings from the
calendar-controlpanel are now available in the event configlet. Since the
calendar portlet was the only consumer of the CalendarTool, the CalendarTool,
the calendar controlpanel and the dependency to Products.CMFCalendar can be
dropped. The new plone.app.widgets package implements archetypes and z3cform
based widgets, so the old datetime widget can be dropped. Python-dateutil
provides recurrence calculations based on the RFC5545 standard -
plone.formwidget.recurrence provides a awidget for recurrence and
Products.DateRecurringIndex an appropriate index as a drop-in replacement for
Zope's DateIndex. The iCalendar package was improved and is now used for
plone.app.event to provide icalendar serialization. The timezone support is
based on the pytz package. Plone now haves a portal timezone, User timezones
and every event can define another timezone, if wished. User timezones are
planned. Whole day events get their starttime set to
0:00 and endtime set to 23:59:59 - thats should be feasable in most cases
  (excluding any scientific events...).


Packages
--------


plone.app.event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.event

The "at" submodule provides the Archetypes based ATEvent content type as a
drop-in replacement of the ATContentType based ATEvent. Ical, recurrence and
generic event accessor adapters and some event subscribers related to the
ATEvent.

The "dx" submodule provides Dexterity behaviors (some granular ones). Like in
the "at" submodule, ical, recurrence and generic event accessor adapters as
well as some event subscribers are provided.

Both subpackages are only loaded, if the neccassary features are installed.

plone.app.event does not depend on CMFCalendar and the portal_calendar tool
any more. Plone core's only consumer of this package was the calendar portlet
anyways, which was completly rewritten.

base.py provides some basic event related functionality. Many of them need a
context in order to get the correct timezone.

The "browser" submodule provides the new "event" controlpanel (the "calendar"
controlpanel can be dropped, since we do not need CMFCalendar any more). The
settings are stored in plone.registry.
The event view is generic to ATEvent and DX based event types.

The ical submodule provides adapters and views for export and import to and
from icalendar resources.

The locales directory which holds locale files.

In the portlets subpackage there are portlet_calendar (a complete rewrite) and
portlet_events, both from plone.app.portlets, where only BBB imports exist, so
that existing installations do not break.

The tests are all ported to plone.app.testing.


plone.event
~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/plone/plone.event

Date/time related utilities, recurrence calculations based on python-dateutil.


plone.formwidget.datetime
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.datetime

Derived from collective.z3cform.datetimewidget and archetypes.datetimewidget
(which itself was derived from the former). It is splitted into "at" and
"z3cform" subpackages, like plone.app.event.


plone.formwidget.recurrence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.recurrence

Recurrence widget based on jquery.recurrenceinput.js. Supports complex
recurrence rules with exclusion and inclusion dates, automatically updated
occurrences display within the widget and a nicely formatted string which
explains the recurrence rule.
The recurrence rule is stored as a RFC5545/icalendar compatible recurrence
string.


Products.DateRecurringIndex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/collective/Products.DateRecurringIndex

A drop-in replacement for Zope's DateIndex with support for recurring events.
Each recurrence get's an index entry.


icalendar
~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/collective/icalendar

icalendar parser/generator framework.


Other, external packages
------------------------

plone.app.eventindex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Github: https://github.com/regebro/plone.app.eventindex

A possible alternative to Products.DateRecurringindex, which supports late
indexing and which does not have problems with unlimited occurrences. This
eventindex is currently not used by plone.app.event.


Python-dateutil
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation: http://labix.org/python-dateutil
Repository: https://launchpad.net/dateutil

Useful extensions to the standard Python datetime features. plone.app.event
uses it mainly for recurrence calculations.


Pytz
~~~~

Documentation: http://pytz.sourceforge.net/
Pypi page: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/

World timezone definitions, modern and historical. Based on the Olson database.
