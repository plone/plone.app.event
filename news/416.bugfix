Add old Plone 5 classes to the portlet template

Add Plone 5 classes portletHeader and portletContent to the portlet template to
improve compatibility with Plone 5 styles.
This can help when migrating styles from Plone 5 to Plone 6.

Note: This targets only portlets yet. There is probably much more to do to
improve the Plone 5 to 6 upgrade experience.
