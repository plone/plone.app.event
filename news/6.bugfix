Support ``icalendar`` 6 by forcing it to use its ``pytz`` timezone implementation.
The new ``zoneinfo`` support in ``icalendar`` 6 does not work for us yet, giving indexing problems.
So we call ``icalendar.use_pytz`` at startup.
If this fails, we must be using an older version where ``pytz`` is the only option anyway, so we ignore this.
